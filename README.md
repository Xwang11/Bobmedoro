# Bobmedoro
A desktop pomedoro timer app built using electron.js featureing hand drawn graphics of adorable dog mascot Bob

I use the pomedoro technique a lot, and wanted to make my own!

## Design Process
I sketched the concept real quick on pocket procreate:

Then I drew some assets and made a prototype on [figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/xBUeyIMs7ONq0dBvMAg6Yx/Bob-Themed-Pomedoro-Timer?node-id=6-182&starting-point-node-id=6%3A182&t=4qBGhwr5ebwbll5P-1)

Once the figma prototyle was up to par, and I have a clear idea of what I want this app to look like, I moved on to the building process

## Building Process (In Progress)
- I started with the html and js to get the layout of major elements done, buttons working, and timer logic functioning, which took a little bit. 
- Now I am on the css process of making everything look like the prototype!!

## More is to come! 
- Adding options on the menu to customize the background and what Bob is focusing on!
- Audio cues when the timer is up
- Possibly integrating app as a browser extension

On macs the app might show as damaged due to extra metadata. Do the following to fix that issue:
- Open terminal
- Type in "xattr -cr \<path-to-the-unzipped-app\>.app"
- Or you can type "xattr -cr " then drag the file to terminal
